					HEART DISEASE ANALYSIS

Dataset Overview


The dataset contains information about patients with various health conditions. The dataset has a total of [insert number] rows and [insert number] columns.


Variables Description


1. sex: Categorical variable indicating the patient's sex (0 - Female, 1 - Male)
2. age: Continuous variable representing the patient's age
3. anaemia: Binary variable indicating whether the patient has anaemia (0 - No, 1 - Yes)
4. diabetes: Binary variable indicating whether the patient has diabetes (0 - No, 1 - Yes)
5. high_blood_pressure: Binary variable indicating whether the patient has high blood pressure (0 - No, 1 - Yes)
6. smoking: Binary variable indicating whether the patient smokes (0 - No, 1 - Yes)
7. DEATH_EVENT: Binary variable indicating whether the patient experienced a death event (0 - No, 1 - Yes)


Data Cleaning and Preprocessing


- The dataset was checked for null values, and any missing values were replaced with the mean of the respective column.
- The 'time' column was removed as it was deemed unnecessary.


Descriptive Statistics


- Gender Distribution: [insert percentage]% female, [insert percentage]% male
- Death Event Distribution: [insert percentage]% no death event, [insert percentage]% death event
- High Blood Pressure Distribution: [insert percentage]% no high blood pressure, [insert percentage]% high blood pressure
- Diabetes Distribution: [insert percentage]% no diabetes, [insert percentage]% diabetes
- Smoking Distribution: [insert percentage]% non-smoker, [insert percentage]% smoker


Visualizations and Insights


1. Pairplot: The pairplot reveals relationships between variables, particularly between age and death event.
2. Sex Distribution Bar Plot: The bar plot shows an equal distribution of males and females.
3. Death Event Distribution Bar Plot: The bar plot indicates a higher number of patients without death events.
4. Death Event per Sex Bar Plot: The bar plot shows a higher death event rate among males.
5. Sex vs Death Event Heatmap: The heatmap confirms a higher death event rate among males.
6. Smoking vs Death Event Bar Plot: The bar plot indicates a higher death event rate among smokers.
7. High Blood Pressure vs Age Box Plot: The box plot reveals a positive correlation between age and high blood pressure.


Conclusion


The analysis provides valuable insights into the relationships between various health conditions and demographic factors. The findings suggest that:


- Males have a higher death event rate.
- Smokers have a higher death event rate.
- High blood pressure increases with age.
- Diabetes and anaemia are significant health concerns.
